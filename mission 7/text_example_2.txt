Dear Red.
	If you're reading this, 
	you've gotten out. And if you've 
	come this far, maybe you're willing 
	to come a little further. You 
	remember the name of the town, 
	don't you? I could use a good man 
	to help me get my project on 
	wheels. I'll keep an eye out for 
	you and the chessboard ready.  
	Remember, Red. Hope is a good 
	thing, maybe the best of things, 
	and no good thing ever dies. I will 
	be hoping that this letter finds 
	you, and finds you well. Your 
	friend. Andy.
